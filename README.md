# iRepresent
#by Hasnain Khan and Adam Kozlowski
This is An app called iRepresent that makes a JSON request to Sunlight Foundation and extracts information about members of congress (such as district, party, date of birth, etc.)
This was our final project for our iOS development class (CSC 471 in spring 2015 at DePaul University).
Looking to add features such as images of members of congress, comment sections, and better a user interface.
